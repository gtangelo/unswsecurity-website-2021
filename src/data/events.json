      "description": "Security detection often feels like being stuck in an endless \ud83c\udf00 cycle \ud83c\udf00. Acquire new data, shift through the data, get overloaded, drive new automation initiatives to get us out of our backlog, and then we break stuff all over again. \n\nWhat if detection at scale wasn\u2019t this at all?  What if our job wasn\u2019t to process logs at all? \ud83d\ude2e\n\nThe Google Detection & Response team would like to show you how we are reframing our perspective of what security engineers should be experts in. Stepping back from the day to day analysis of endless log sources. Instead, we research new detection ideas and codify those into a framework supported by end to end testing. Examples of how real Google security engineers approach this idea included. \n\n\u2728\u2728Introducing our speakers for this event...\u2728\u2728\n\n\ud83d\udc64 Kris:\n\nKris Hunt is the senior manager of the Australian arm of the Google \nDetection team. He has focused on the detection side of security for the past 18 years and today, his role is to lead teams of security engineers who innovate and evolve Alphabet\u2019s detection systems to match the ever increasing sophistication of attackers.\n\n\ud83d\udc64 Grace:\n\nGrace Nolan is a Security Engineer at Google working in Detection & Response. She is responsible for detection of malicious activity on Google's networks and deep analysis of threats on their corporate, production, and acquisition environments. She works on engineering challenges that get Google closer to having fully automated detection and response systems. In her spare time she likes mentoring women in tech, playing video games, and painting watercolours.\n\n\n----- STAY IN TOUCH -----\nDiscord: https://secso.cc/discord\nFacebook Page: https://secso.cc/fb-page\nFacebook Group: https://secso.cc/fb-group\nYoutube: https://secso.cc/youtube\nNewsletter: https://secso.cc/newsletter\nSpArc: https://secso.cc/join",

There'll also be free pizza \ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf55 \u203c\ufe0f\n\n\nBug bounties have become an established process in organisations with a mature security posture. Over the last five years, we have been submitting vulnerabilities to companies in almost every industry. By participating in bug bounties over such a long period of time, there has been an evolution in the skills, reporting and payouts. There is a broad perception in bounties that there is a secret to unlock to be successful and only a handful of individuals are capable of that success. This presentation will break down why that is not the case. We will walk through all of our favourite bugs that we have found in the last five years, explaining step by step what led to the discoveries. We will discuss some of the lessons we have learned from our participation, and how you can replicate our success.\n\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udde3  SPEAKERS \ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udde3\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Shubham:\nShubham Shah is the co-founder and CTO of Assetnote, a platform for continuous monitoring of your external attack surface.

He has presented at various industry events including Kiwicon, BSides Canberra and 44Con.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Sean:\nSean is the Engineering Lead at Assetnote. He is a casual bug bounty hunter, occasionally manually finding critical bugs while his automations submit the rest. He has presented at DEFCON and Hack In The Box, and lectured Web Application Security at UNSW.",

Namely, if one could truly understand how a certain model works, and the type of features it uses to reach a decision, then there is a potential to deceive it consistently, creating a bypass while maintaining a false sense of security. In this talk, we will walk through our research in which we have reversed engineered Cylance's AI based EPP to create a unique and amusing bypass.\u201d\n\n\nSPEAKER BIOGRAPHY: ADI ASHKENAZY \n\n\nAdi is currently the CEO of Skylight Cyber, a boutique cyber security advisory based in Sydney. Previously, he served as the deputy director of an elite cyber technology department in the Israeli government, leading Israel\u2019s finest engineers and security professionals through some of the world\u2019s most complex cyber security challenges. In addition, he served as VP Product for XM Cyber, where he designed the world\u2019s first fully automated red team solution, an achievement for which the company received the world economic forum technology pioneer award and numerous patents.\n\n\nJOB OPPORTUNITY\n\n\nSkylight Cyber is also looking for exceptional talent to join its team in Sydney in the role of cybersecurity specialist.\n\nThis specific opportunity is ideal if you already have a couple of years of pen-testing or red-teaming under your belt, and you want to accelerate your professional growth.\n\nHowever, Skylight Cyber are willing to consider recent/soon-to-be grads provided that you can demonstrate a track record of excellence and passion for cybersecurity.\n\nThey offer an above market salary package, an opportunity to work on cutting-edge security projects with Australia's leading brands and dedicated time for innovative security research.\n\nMore information about the role and the opportunity to apply through this link: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2403503622/",

We organise a range of social and technical events for students to meet others interested in cybersecurity, develop their technical skills and knowledge through workshops and capture-the-flag competitions, and to learn more about careers in security through industry talks and networking opportunities.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 2021 DIRECTORSHIP WITH SECSOC\n\nIf you are interested in security and motivated to develop UNSW\u2019s vibrant security community, then we strongly encourage you to apply for a director position! There is no requirement for students to have done a security course or to have experience in security.\n\nAs we are hoping to expand our society in 2021, a key change from 2020 is that SecSoc directors will be given the opportunity to recruit and lead their own subcommittees to assist with their responsibilities.\n\nThis document outlines the available director positions for SecSoc in 2021 and their key responsibilities: https://link.unswsecurity.com/Director-info\n\nThe expected time commitment will vary between roles. The current expectation is about 3-5 hours per week on average. \n\nWe are recruiting approximately:\n\n- 2 Careers Directors\n- 2 CTF Directors\n- 2 Events Directors\n- 2 Media Directors\n- 2 Project Directors\n\nWe will finalise the numbers based on the quality of applicants and the assessed workload of initiatives proposed by candidates in the application process.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f APPLICATION PROCESS FOR 2021 DIRECTORSHIP\n\nCandidates for director positions will be assessed on their initiative, motivation and commitment to contributing to SecSoc. Attributes including leadership, effective time management, ability to work in a team, and organisation skills will also be a key consideration. \n\nApplicants can apply to be a SecSoc director until the nomination deadline by filling in this form: https://link.unswsecurity.com/director-application\n\nOnline interviews will be conducted on a rolling basis. Candidates will be interviewed by two members of the society at a date to be decided by the availability of the candidate and the executive team. The interviewing date can be between the date of submission of the application and the interviewing deadline. \n\nNomination Deadline: \t\tFriday 11th December 2020\nInterviewing Deadline: \t\tFriday 18th December 2020\n\n\ud83d\ude0e ELIGIBILITY\n\nApplicants must be a full member of SecSoc at the time of position acceptance and during their term. That is, you must be a UNSW student and a member of the society on SpArc for the duration of your term. Each position will be held from appointment until handovers to the 2022 directors and executives are complete.\n\n\ud83d\udcac WHO TO TALK TO\n\nIf you have any questions about any of the director roles or the application process, feel free to contact the 2021 executive team at execs@unswsecurity.com.\n\n2021 Executive Team\n\nPresident: Giuliana De Bellis\nVice President: Ada Luong\nSecretary: Michael Gribben\nTreasurer: Tom Nguyen\nArc Delegate: Vicknesh Ravikumar \n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to all the applicants and the amazing 2021 you\u2019ll assist us in making.",

Email is not only a primary communication channel but also required for registering with online services and profession-specific portals. When law firms merge or wind-up, internet domain names are often abandoned, allowing anyone to re-register and take ownership of the former firm\u2019s domain name. The new owner can then, among other things take control of the former firm\u2019s email services.\n\nIn this talk, we explore how we managed to gain access to, or reset passwords for online services and profession-specific portals. These online services store documents, emails and other information relating to a legal practice, including financial details, personal information, confidential information and client-legal privileged information. We also make recommendations as to measures legal practices and other businesses can take to stop this threat.\n\nGabor Szathmari is a cybersecurity expert with over ten years experience, having worked in both private and public sectors. He has helped numerous big-name clients with data breach investigations and security incident management. In his professional life, Gabor helps businesses, including many small and mid-size legal practices improve their cybersecurity at Iron Bastion. He is also the president of CryptoAUSTRALIA, the leading authority promoting a society where all Australians can learn to defend their privacy",

      "description": "With recent advances in mobile computing and sensing technology, smart wearable devices have pervaded our everyday lives. The security of these wearable devices is becoming a hot research topic because they store various private information. Existing approaches either only rely on a secret PIN number or require an explicit user authentication process, which is not user-friendly. In this talk, Dr. Wen Hu will discuss lightweight biometric authentication and key generation research based on gait analysis in their group that addresses the challenges at signal processing, feature engineering and recognition. \n\nBio: Dr. Wen Hu is a senior lecturer at School of Computer Science and Engineering, the University of New South Wales (UNSW). Much of his research career has focused on the novel applications, low-power communications, security and compressive sensing in sensor network systems and Internet of Things (IoT). Hu published regularly in the top rated sensor network and mobile computing venues such as ACM/IEEE IPSN, ACM SenSys, ACM transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN), IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC), and Proceedings of the IEEE.\n\nHu was a principal research scientist and research project leader at CSIRO Digital Productivity Flagship, and received his Ph.D from the UNSW. He is a recipient of prestigious CSIRO Office of Chief Executive (OCE) Julius Career Award (2012 - 2015) and multiple research grants from Australian Research Council, CSIRO and industries.\n\nHu is a senior member of ACM and IEEE, and is an associate editor of ACM TOSN, as well as serves on technical advisory board (IoT) of ACS and the organising and program committees of networking conferences including ACM/IEEE IPSN, ACM SenSys, ACM MobiSys, ACM/IEEE IOTDI, IEEE ICDCS, IEEE LCN, IEEE ICC, IEEE WCNC, IEEE DCOSS, IEEE GlobeCom, IEEE PIMRC, and IEEE VTC.",
